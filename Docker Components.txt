1. Docker Image  -> Eg.Ubuntu + node.js + application code

2. Docker Containers -> Live Application Run (Running Image)

3. Docker Client -> Manage Containers (start/stop/delete. Docker Client is integrate with Docker Engine + OS

Docker Client == Docker Ship
Docker Engine == Crane to offload from or onload to the ship

4. Docker Engine -> Help client to stop/start/de;ete container (like, Crane to offload from or onload to the ship).

5. Docker ToolBox -> provide image + container tools, provides VM for windows and Mac. So container can tun on Linux VM.
(forn windows 10 Pro or Mac, use Docker Community Edition tool)

6. Docker Machine ->  Allow to manage VM/VMs.If we use docker toolbox, will be used little bit. If Community Edition , 
probably not req. except specific scenario where we want to interact with VM

7. Docker Compose -> Allow to set multiple containers + interact between them

8. Docker Kitemetic -> GUI for grabbing image etc. 

9. Docker Virtual Box -> it will came if we use Docker ToolBox. It gives us a CLI to run Linux commands.
